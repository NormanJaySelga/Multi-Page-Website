        <h3>Interstellar</h3>
        <img src="https://wallpapers.com/images/featured/interstellar-d5hpgadclxszmpeh.jpg" alt="Interstellar">
        <p>I chose Interstellar because it combines an emotional story with stunning science fiction. The depiction of space travel, time dilation, and the father-daughter relationship makes it both intellectually and emotionally engaging. What’s great about this movie is its breathtaking visuals, incredible soundtrack, and a thought-provoking storyline about survival and love.</p>

        <p>The Dark Knight is one of my favorite movies because of its complex characters and thrilling plot. Heath Ledger’s portrayal of the Joker is unforgettable and adds depth to the story. I appreciate how the movie blends action, suspense, and moral dilemmas, making it not just entertaining but also meaningful. The cinematography and score are also top-notch.</p>

        <h3>Spider-Man</h3>
        <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmFiZGZjMmEtMTA0Ni00MzA2LTljMTYtZGI2MGJmZWYzZTQ2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg" alt="Spider-Man">
        <p>I love Spider-Man because it perfectly balances superhero action with humor and heart. Peter Parker’s journey of responsibility resonates with everyone. The movie is fun, visually exciting, and emotionally satisfying. What’s good about it is that it shows how ordinary people can rise to do extraordinary things, inspiring viewers while keeping them entertained.</p>
